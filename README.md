# 👋 Hi, I'm Pranita Jain

I’m a passionate **JavaScript Developer** who enjoys building clean, user-friendly web applications and improving them with solid UX and performance-focused thinking.

I like working close to the browser, understanding *why* things behave the way they do, and refining small details that make a big difference.
